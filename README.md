Synopsis
A simple attempt to create a video game with Python. 
Main objective of this game, Alien Invasion, is to shoot down aliens before they reach the bottom. 
It uses pygame library to run.

I used Kim Jong-Un as a villan, but when peace finally arrives between North and South Korea, he will be removed from the villans.
